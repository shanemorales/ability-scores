# ability-scores

DESCRIPTION

This project will replicate the generation of ability scores from the Dungeons & Dragons game.

The process that will emulated is this:

There are six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom Charisma).
Each ability score is generated by rolling 4 six-sided dice, discarding the lowest die, and adding the remaiming three dice together.

The goal is to have an HTML page that will generate and display six ability scores by clicking a button.
